# Usage:
# % ./scripts/fix-ca-for-k3s.sh [member-cluster] ...
#
# Description:
# This script fixes up the configuration for k3s. (https://k3s.io/)
# Namely it updates ca.crt in secrets to match with the ones in
# KUBECONFIG. It's intended to be run after deploy-federation.sh
# script.
#
# Background:
# In k3s, different endpoints and certificates are configured for
# users (KUBECONFIG) and pods (service accounts).
# Because "kubefedctl join" uses the endpoint from KUBECONFIG and
# the certificate from a service account in the member cluster,
# the federation controller manager fails to communicate with the
# member clusters, producing the messages like the following.
#
# 	x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
